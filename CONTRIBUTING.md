# Contributing
You are welcome to [report Issues](https://github.com/twof/MrMeeseeksSlackBot/issues) or [pull requests](https://github.com/twof/MrMeeseeksSlackBot/pulls). It's recommended that you read the following Contributing Guide first before contributing.


## Issues
Github Issues is used to track public bugs and feature requests.

### Search Known Issues First
Please search existing issues to see if any similar issue or feature request has already been filed. You should make sure your issue isn't redundant.

### Reporting New Issues
If you open an issue, the more information you provide the better. An example of a
well reported issue might be one that includes a screenshot, what was expected to
happen and what actually occurred.

## Pull Requests
Pull requests are welcome so that Mr Meeseeks may better server everyone!

### Which Branch?
Pull requests should be made to the `dev` branch whether you're contributing a plugin
or to the bot core itself.
