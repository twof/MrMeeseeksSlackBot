# Contributing
You are welcome to [report Issues](https://github.com/twof/MrMeeseeksSlackBot/issues) or [pull requests](https://github.com/twof/MrMeeseeksSlackBot/pulls). It's recommended that you read the following Contributing Guide first before contributing.


## Issues
Github Issues is used to track public bugs and feature requests.

### Search Known Issues First
Please search existing issues to see if any similar issue or feature request has already been filed. You should make sure your issue isn't redundant.

### Reporting New Issues
If you open an issue, the more information you provide the better. An example of a well reported issue might be one that includes a screenshot, what was expected to happen and what actually occurred.

## Pull Requests
Pull requests are welcome so that Mr. Meeseeks may better server everyone!

### Which Branch?
Pull requests should be made to the `dev` branch whether you're contributing a plugin or to the bot core itself.
The only exception is edits to documentation (README, inline documentation, etc.). Those requests can be made into `master`.

### Testing
(Applicable only once test suite exists)
All plugins must be run through the plugin test suite. Pull request will only be accepted if they contain pasted output from tests.

## Code Style Guide
Tabs for indentation.
