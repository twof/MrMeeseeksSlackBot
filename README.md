# Mr Meeseeks
## State: Not functioning
Be aware of the state of the bot when forking. Once the plugin system is complete I'll be sure to do breaking development on the dev branch. Sorry about that guys. 
### TODO:
* Plugin System
* Write plugin test suite so devs can test their plugins without an api key
* Personality class with show quotes
* Write guide to writing plugins

### Contributing:
If you'd like to contribute before the plugin system is implemented, concoct ways to to give Mr Meeseeks more personality. Otherwise look at the plugin superclass and write a plugin for the future in accordance with that.
