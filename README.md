# Mr Meeseeks

### TODO:
* Plugin System
* Write plugin test suite so devs can test their plugins without an api key
* Personality class with show quotes
* Write guide to writing plugins

### Contributing:
If you'd like to contribute before the plugin system is implemented, concoct ways to to give Mr Meeseeks more personality. Otherwise look at the plugin superclass and write a plugin for the future in accordance with that.
