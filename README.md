# Mr Meeseeks

### v1 TODO:
* Add listener timeouts
* Add means to delete listeners from within a class other than the one they were created in. This will more likely than not be the primary use case.
* Debug and refactor
* Write more basic, offline plugin that makes use of followups and context. Weather has rapidly spiraled out of control

### v2 TODO:
These are low priority and won't be worked on by myself until the v1 queue is cleared out. If someone else would like to develop any v2 features, they should feel free to.

* Refactor into usable framework
* Switch to Slack RTM protocol
* Introduce media support (sending/receiving)
* NLP parsing
    * Split messages into parts of speech

### v3 TODO:
* Plugin marketplace
* Bot hosting service

### Low Priority
* Add support for regex flags
