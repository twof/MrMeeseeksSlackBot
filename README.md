### v1 TODO:
* Write system for plugin followups
    * Example: "What's the weather in Cincinnati?"
    * Followup: "Do you mean
                 1. Cincinnati, IA, United States
                 2. Cincinnati, OH, United States"

### v2 TODO:
These are low priority and won't be worked on by myself until the v1 queue is cleared out. If someone else would like to develop any v2 features, they should feel free to.

* Refactor into usable framework
* Switch to Slack RTM protocol
* Introduce media support (sending/receiving)
* Add support for regex flags

### v3 TODO:
* Plugin marketplace
* Bot hosting service
